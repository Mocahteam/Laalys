# Laalys
Laalys (Learner Activity AnaLYser) is a software enabling to analyze player's traces in order to generate pedagogical labels about the learner's behavior in Serious Games. The first version of Laalys was designed during doctoral works of [Pradeepa Thomas](https://www.lip6.fr/actualite/personnes-fiche.php?ident=D1069).

Laalys is included inside [E-LearningScape](https://github.com/Mocahteam/E-LearningScape) to produce in-game feedbacks depending on players' difficulties.
